# segmentation-with-kmeans-clustering

We use a bank of texture filters along with K-means clustering algorithm, to segment an image into foreground and background regions. The foreground region will then be extracted from the original image and placed in a separate background image. As an application of this technique, an animal is transferred from one image to another
